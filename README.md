# ChessAndroid
The latest Chess project that I've written was a version of Chess for android.  This was a project for my Software Methodology class from my Sophomore year of college.  In this implementation of Chess, I mostly adapted my old version written in C# to Java, and then added the Android UI on top of that.

Even though this was a project that I did for school, and I tend to think that I've done most of my best programming on side projects outside of school, I felt particularly proud of this project while I was developing it, and it really does feel like the "best" version of Chess that I've written -- with all the OOP nicities of CSharpChess, and the nice UI of Android.  So, I decided to include it on my GitHub.
